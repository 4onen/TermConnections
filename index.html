        <h2>How to Play</h2>
        <p>Term connections is a game about sorting the given terms into
            categories of similar terms. Click on tiles to select them.
            When you have selected as many tiles as there are terms in a
            category, the <b>Submit</b> button will become available for you to
            guess the category. If you guess correctly, the tiles will be
            merged into a category. Find all of the categories to win!</p>
        <p>The <b>Shuffle</b> button is there just to rearrange the tiles for
            you. You may shuffle as many times as you like, but it will not
            affect your score, selections, or discovered categories.</p>
        <p>Under the <b>Report</b> button, you can access a grid detailing
            to which categories your answers belong - but only once you've
            placed the relevant terms into the right categories!</p>
